# Time Series analysis
Data contains time series Data from Jan 2010 to Mar 2020. The Predictions are to be made on at least 15 Months data.

## the model_architecture.py file contains the model architecture implemented in Keras. 
## the model architecture is based on the the architecture defined in neural_net_architecture.png file.
## results on validation data
r-squared = 99.72
Directional_accuracy = 78%
absolute_percentage_error = 12.5% 
### The model is optiamised using 'mape' loss function. 

## For Custom use of this repo please refer the Jupyter notebook in the repo.
